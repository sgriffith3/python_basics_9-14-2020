Using the custom if/elif/else logic you have already created for
lab #18, it is your job to improve the code in the following ways:

- Copy your code into a new file - custom_func.py
- Create a csv file with at least 3 rows of test data in it 
    *CSV data can be only one column wide*
- In your custom_func.py script, read the information in from the csv file
- Place your existing if/elif/else code in a function
- Run your function against each row of information in your csv file


Rocket-Scientists Only:
- Place your logic inside of a try/except block and account for ValueErrors
- Add another csv file with more data. Combine the data from both files.
- Instead of printing items to the screen, sort them, and print them out in groups
